First you need to install on target server an agent and xinetd, after this steps, you can proceed:

To install the plugin, copy the file mk_mysql to your $MK_LIBDIR/plugins directory. $MK_LIBDIR is configured in the beginning of the base Checkmk agent and is often set to /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins.

After that, make the script executable using chmod 700 mk_mysql and try running it using "./mk_mysql".

For most people it will be complaining it's not authorized to access MySQL.

This is because the MySQL root user needs to be accessible for the OS user used by the check_mk_agent. Almost any way of solving this has some security impact, we settled for storing the password in a file in $MK_CONFIDR which normally is /etc/check_mk. This file should have mode "400" (set with chmod again) and be called "mysql.cfg". Setting mode 400 ensures it will not be readable for non-root users.

In it, you store the password and optional a user for MySQL to use for authentication in the following MySQL format:

/etc/check_mk/mysql.cfg

[client]
user=monitor
password=MyPassWord

if mysql without password:

[client]
user=root
